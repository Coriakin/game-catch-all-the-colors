# Catch all the colors Game ðŸŒˆ

## Background / Why?
To get my kid more into gaming, I had an idea of getting her excited about coming up with ideas for games that she can then play. It is a struggle finding games that are not scary, or where you are punished when failing and so on. We bounce ideas, and will probably prototype on paper and I will try to implement the ideas, we shall see where this ends up and if it's a regular thing.
